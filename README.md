## How to run the project

1. Make sure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed.

2. Clone the repo to local

3. Open Terminal, go to the cloned repository directory, and run `docker compose up`. This will pull the pre-built image, and start a RStudio server with the dependencies.

4. Go to http://localhost:8787/ to access the web version of RStudio. Navigate to the `~/dissertation` directory and open the .Rproject file there.

## Video game

In Study 3, I developed a video game and asked participants to play it.
The video game is currently hosted on [itch.io (Shadow of Gaki)](https://nsunami.itch.io/shadow-of-gaki).
