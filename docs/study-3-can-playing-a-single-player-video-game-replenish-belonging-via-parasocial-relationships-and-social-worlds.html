<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Study 3: Can Playing a Single-Player Video Game Replenish Belonging via Parasocial Relationships and Social Worlds?</h1>
<p>Study 2 tested whether recalling about a time playing a social surrogacy
video game can replenish belonging after social rejection. Social
surrogate video games involve two distinct social surrogates, according
to the social surrogacy hypothesis. First, people who write about a
social surrogacy video game may experience parasocial
relationships—they may have thought about emotional bonds with their
favorite characters like players of the Mass Effect series report
attachments to Tali and Garrus <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-burgess2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Burgess &amp; Jones, 2020</a>)</span>. Second, people may have
experienced social worlds—they may have remembered the time they were
immersed in the story and felt like being a member of the game’s social
world. Although Study 2 tested that social surrogates could replenish
belonging following social rejection, whether parasocial relationships,
social worlds, or the combination of the two can increase belonging in
single-player games remains unknown.</p>
<p>In Study 3, I decomposed the effects of parasocial relationships and the
social world on belonging after social rejection. To do so, I developed
an original game to independently manipulate the degree of parasocial
relationships (high vs. low) and social worlds (high vs. low). Using a
new original video game also eliminated any influence from participants’
familiarity with the game since all participants played this game for
the first time. All participants first experienced social rejection and
then played the video game with varying degrees of parasocial
relationships and social worlds. The goal of this study was to test
Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>I label degrees of parasocial relationships and social worlds as high
vs. low, instead of present vs. absent, since people see social agency
in most visual stimuli even in geometric figures
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-heiderExperimentalStudyApparent1944" role="doc-biblioref">Heider &amp; Simmel, 1944</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-schollPerceptualCausalityAnimacy2000" role="doc-biblioref">Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000</a>)</span>, and thus I cannot rule out the
possibility that people do not experience parasocial relationships or
social worlds.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Method</h2>
<div id="sample-size-rationale-1" class="section level3" number="6.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Sample Size Rationale</h3>
<p>No estimate for the effect size for this study is available, and thus I
used the safeguarded effect size in Study 2 as the target effect size
(<em>d</em> = 0.35). The current study was a 2 (Parasocial Relationships: High
vs. Low) x 2 (Social Worlds: High vs. Low) between-subjects design. I
followed a recommendation to base the patterns of group mean differences
to estimate an effect size
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lakensSimulationBasedPowerAnalysisFactorial2019" role="doc-biblioref">Lakens &amp; Caldwell, 2019</a>)</span>. For the current
power analysis, I treated Cohen’s <em>d</em> as the differences in the group
means by assuming the pooled standard deviation of 1. I used the
<em>Superpower</em> R package to perform power analysis
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lakensSimulationBasedPowerAnalysisFactorial2019" role="doc-biblioref">Lakens &amp; Caldwell, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the main goal of the study was to test the effects of parasocial
relationships and social worlds on belonging, I calculated the required
sample size based on the main effect of each. I assumed that the main
effects of the parasocial relationship manipulation and the social world
manipulation would each have an effect size of <em>d</em> = 0.35 (Hypotheses 2
and 3). The resulting target sample size to achieve .90 power and .05
alpha is 344 participants in total (86 per condition x 4 conditions).
This sample size is enough to detect <em>d</em> = 0.50 with .90 power and .05
alpha for the ancillary Hypothesis 4 (86 per group). See Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-expected-means">6.1</a> for the expected pattern of the means used
for the power analysis.</p>

<div id="participants-6" class="section level3" number="6.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Participants</h3>
<p>I recruited 469 participants via the
psychology participant pool at the University of Delaware. The final
analytic sample size was 344 after exclusions
(see Exclusions and Stopping Rule below). Among the included
participants, 207 (60.17%)
identified as woman, 130 (37.79%)
identified as man, and 7 (37.79)
identified as neither man or woman. For the racial identity,
265 (77.03%) identified as White,
39 (11.34%) as Asian,
15
(4.36%) as Black/African-American,
and 25
(7.27%) as belonging to other racial
category or to multiple racial categories. Participants received partial
course credit for participation. Participants were eligible to
participate if they have access to a computer to play the custom game on
a web browser.</p>
<p>The current study used a novel RPG with a fictional story with dialogues
with non-player characters—both important components for the
parasocial relationship and social world manipulations. However, some
people may dislike stories and dialogues and ignore them in their
gameplay. If I recruited only participants disinterested in stories, the
manipulations in this study would be ineffective simply because they are
not paying attention to the manipulation. To minimize the issue, I asked
prospective participants to answer the story subscale of the Gaming
Attitudes, Motives, and Experiences Scale to measure people’s interests
in stories in video games <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hilgardIndividualDifferencesMotives2013" role="doc-biblioref">Hilgard et al., 2013</a>)</span>.
Then, I prioritized inviting participants with higher interests in
stories for participation.</p>
<p>Prioritizing the participation of people who liked storytelling also
increased the external validity of the study. In reality, single-player
video games with social surrogates are usually role-playing games with
stories and dialogues with other characters. People who regularly play
these games should have interests in stories in the first place since
people usually purchase and play video games they like. If I happen to
only recruit participants who dislike stories, our sample would not be
representative of the consumers of single-player video games with social
surrogates. The results of the study has the most implications for those
who are likely to play single-player video games–prioritizing their
participation incrased the generality and impact of the study in the
long run.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Procedure</h3>
<p>Participants accessed an online study website, signed an informed
consent, and completed the demographics questions. Participants also
completed the baseline Heart Manikin (Time 1) and the original
Self-Assessment Manikin, consistent with Study 2. To increase
participants’ engagement with the study materials, I offered monetary
incentives for attending to study materials. Specifically, participants
were told that they would complete a pop quiz about the materials of the
study at the end, and if they answered all questions right they would be
entered into a drawing to receive a $10 Amazon Gift card. Then, all
participants completed the social rejection essay used in Study 2.</p>
<p>After completing the social rejection essay, participants played a
custom single-player video game, called <em>Shadows of Gaki</em> (Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-screenshots">6.2</a>), developed for this study on RPG Maker MV
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-kadokawacorporationRPGMakerMV2015" role="doc-biblioref">KADOKAWA Corporation, 2015</a>)</span>. I programmed the video game to
independently manipulate parasocial relationships and social worlds.
Participants spent on the average of 30.48
minutes to play the game (<em>M</em> = 30.48, <em>SD</em> = 63.69).</p>

<p>In this game, the player took the role of Higra, the main character who
solves the mystery of a plague affecting the village of Azmar. I set the
gender of the main player character as female for two reasons. First,
past research showed that players adapt the characteristics of the
player character and change how they play the game accordingly (called
the Proteus effect)—such as killing more when playing a male
character, and healing more when playing a female character
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-yeeMenHealMore2011" role="doc-biblioref">Yee et al., 2011</a>)</span>. I held the gender of the player character
constant in my game to avoid any influence from the Proteus effect.
Second, women tend to prefer a female character over a male character
whereas men do not have preferences <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-paikPlayfulGenderSwapping2013" role="doc-biblioref">Paik &amp; Shi, 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-ratanWomenKeepIt2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ratan et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Thus, both female and male participants would
like playing a female player character. For these reasons, I held the
gender of the player character female for all participants.</p>
<p>The contents presented in this single-player game varied depending on
the experimental conditions. I manipulated the parasocial relationships
via the presence of the companion non-player character Sashu. In the
high parasocial relationship condition, the player had an opportunity to
form a parasocial relationship with Sashu. Sashu guided the player
throughout the gameplay and healed the player during the battles if the
player’s hit point was low. In the low parasocial relationship
condition, Sashu was not be present in the gameplay.</p>
<p>I manipulated the social worlds via the opportunities for immersing into
the story of the video game, and thus facilitating the collective
assimilation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gabrielSocialSurrogatesRejection2017" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel &amp; Valenti, 2017a</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gabrielBecomingVampireBeing2011" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel &amp; Young, 2011b</a>)</span>. In the high social world
condition, the player was presented the story of Higra answering the
Emperor’s call to be a Samga in the hopes of reuniting with Mother. In
the low social world condition, the player was not presented with these
storytelling components. After playing the video game, participants
completed the Heart Manikin and the original Self-Assessment Manikin
again (Time 2). Then, participants indicated whether they interacted
with the non-player characters in their essay (Yes or No). If the answer
was Yes, they first named the character that they felt most connected to
(“Thinking about the non-player characters [NPCs] that you interacted
with, whom did you feel most connected to?”), and they completed the
modified Inclusion of Self in Other Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aronInclusionOtherSelf1992" role="doc-biblioref">Aron et al., 1992</a>)</span>.
Then, participants completed the modified Single-Item Immersion Scale
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-reysenInitialValidationReliability2019" role="doc-biblioref">Reysen et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Then, participants will
complete the modified Single-Item Immersion Scale
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-reysenInitialValidationReliability2019" role="doc-biblioref">Reysen et al., 2019</a>)</span>, the on-the-fly measure of

participants completed the identification subscale of the player

<p>The Heart Manikin and the modified Inclusion of Ingroup in the Self

<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-troppIngroupIdentificationInclusion2016" role="doc-biblioref">Tropp &amp; Wright, 2016</a>)</span> were identical to the ones
used in Study 2. I modified the language of the Inclusion of Self In
Other Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aronInclusionOtherSelf1992" role="doc-biblioref">Aron et al., 1992</a>)</span> used in Study 2 to measure
parasocial relationships with the characters of the custom video game.
Similarly, I modified the language of the Single-Item Immersion Scale
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-reysenInitialValidationReliability2019" role="doc-biblioref">Reysen et al., 2019</a>)</span> and the on-the-fly measure of
social worlds to measure the degrees of immersion and social world while
playing the custom video game. I also modified the language of the
Enjoyment Subscale of the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale to
refer to the game that participants just played (e.g., “I thought the
game was fun”). Cronbach’s alphas for the current sample were
0.92 for the Enjoyment Subscale of the Game User
Experience Satisfaction Scale, and 0.86 for
the on-the-fly measure of social world.</p>
<p><strong>Player Character Identification - Similarity Subscale.</strong> I used the
identification similarity subscale from the Player Character
Identification Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-vanlooy2012" role="doc-biblioref">Van Looy et al., 2012a</a>)</span>. The subscale consisted of 6
statements on the similarities between the player and the player
character (e.g., “My character is like me in many ways”). I will modify
the scale so that they refer to the video game in the study (e.g., “My
character was like me in many ways”). Cronbach’s alpha for the current
sample was 0.96. I will treat this scale as
exploratory and thus do not pre-register any analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Check.</strong> Consistent with Study 2, participants were asked
about the nature of the first essay: “In today’s study, you were asked
to write an essay. What were you asked to write about?” Participants
could answer this question as “about a time I felt rejected,” “about a
time I felt accepted,” and “about my morning yesterday.” I marked
participants as failing the attention check if they indicate that they
were asked to write about a time they felt accepted or about their
morning yesterday.</p>
<p>For checking participants’ attention to the parasocial relationship
manipulation, I asked participants, “What was the name of the non-player
character who followed you throughout the gameplay?” The answer choices
were, “Sashu,” “Akiko” (filler), and “None—I did not have anyone who
followed me throughout the game.” I marked the following participants as
failing the attention check: participants in the higher parasocial
relationship condition who report “Akiko” or “None,” and participants in
the lower parasocial relationship condition who report “Sashu” or
“Akiko.” For checking the social world manipulation, I will ask
participants, “What was the story presented in the game?” Answer
choices were (a) “Higra answered the emperor’s call and became a Samga,
fighting for good, defeating the evil boss and reuniting with her mother
at the end,” (b) “Higra prepared a special dish for grandma’s birthday”
(Filler), (c) “Higra battled evil bosses throughout the game, eventually
winning, but did not reunite with her mother at the end.” I marked the
following participants as failing the attention check: participants in
the higher social worlds condition who answered (b) or (c), and
participants in the lower social worlds condition who answer (a) or (b).</p>
</div>
<div id="exclusion-and-stopping-rule" class="section level3" number="6.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.5</span> Exclusion and Stopping Rule</h3>
<p>I excluded any participants who fail to complete the entire study
procedure or fail the attention check. Overall, I excluded
125 participants for failing at least one of the three
attention checks. Among them,
18 participants failed
the essay attention check,
75 participants
failed the parasocial relationships attention check, and
60 participants
failed the social world attention check. I also excluded one participant
who stopped the study for more than 4 days while playing the game. I
continued recruiting participants until the sample size after exclusions
reached the target sample size.</p>
</div>
<div id="deviations-from-the-proposal" class="section level3" number="6.1.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.6</span> Deviations from the Proposal</h3>
<p>I proposed to use the Parasocial Interaction—Process Scale
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-schrammPSIProcessScalesNew2008" role="doc-biblioref">Schramm &amp; Hartmann, 2008a</a>)</span> and the modified Narrative Engagement
Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-busselleMeasuringNarrativeEngagement2009" role="doc-biblioref">Busselle &amp; Bilandzic, 2009</a>)</span>. After testing the
study, I found that the entire study was taking longer than anticipated.
To reduce the time of participation, I decided to remove these two
scales. Then, participants completed the modified Single-Item Immersion
Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-reysenInitialValidationReliability2019" role="doc-biblioref">Reysen et al., 2019</a>)</span>, the modified Narrative
Engagement Scale <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-busselleMeasuringNarrativeEngagement2009" role="doc-biblioref">Busselle &amp; Bilandzic, 2009</a>)</span>, the
on-the-fly measure of social world, and the Enjoyment Subscale of the
Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale [GUESS;

<p>Initially, the answer choices for the social world were (a) “Higra
answered the Emperor’s call to be a Samga and reunited with Mother,” (b)
“Higra prepared a special dish for grandma’s birthday” (Filler), and (c)
“None—I did not see any story in the video game.” After recruiting
19 participants, I saw that many participants in the lower
social world condition still answered seeing a story (a) rather than
seeing none (c). I speculated that some participants in the lower social
condition may have imagined their own story while playing the game, thus
not choosing (c). To prevent this issue, I changed the answer choices to
(c) “Higra battled evil bosses throughout the game.” After recruiting
another 247 participants, I still saw that this issue
persisted. I further changed the answer choices to (a) “Higra answered
the emperor’s call and became a Samga, fighting for good, defeating the
evil boss and reuniting with her mother at the end” and (c) “Higra
battled evil bosses throughout the game, eventually winning, but did not
reunite with her mother at the end.”
Two hundred three participants
completed this final version.</p>

<div id="results-6" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Results</h2>
<p><strong>Main Analysis</strong>. I ran a 2 (Parasocial Relationships: High vs. Low) x
2 (Social Worlds: High vs. Low) ANOVA on the Heart Manikin scores at
Time 2. Contrary to the predictions, I did not observe the main effect
of the parasocial relationships (Hypothesis 2;
<em>F</em>(1, 340) = 0.87, <em>p</em> = .353), and the main effect of the social worlds
(Hypothesis 3; <em>F</em>(1, 340) = 0.94, <em>p</em> = .333). Similarly, I also did not
observe the Parasocial Relationships x Social Worlds interaction effect
(<em>F</em>(1, 340) = 0.12, <em>p</em> = .726). As a planned contrast, I
compared the belonging scores of those in the Low Parasocial
Relationships and Low Social Worlds condition to those in the High
Parasocial Relationships and High Social Worlds condition to test
Hypothesis 4. Results did not show a difference in Heart Manikin Scores
at Time 2 (<em>t</em> = -1.29, <em>p</em> = .568, <em>d</em> = -0.20, 90%CI [-0.46, 0.06]; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-heart2-plot">6.3</a> A).</p>
<p>Since the obtained p-values were greater than .05 for the analyses for
Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4, I performed the two one-sided test of
equivalence, consistent with the procedure in Study 2 (Lakens, 2017).
Again all effect sizes smaller than |<em>d</em>| = 0.35 are
considered theoretically equivalent to zero. The 90% confidence
intervals fell within the SESOI for the main effect of the parasocial
realationships (<em>d</em> = -0.05, 90%CI [-0.20, 0.11]) and the main effect
of social world (<em>d</em> = -0.09, 90%CI [-0.24, 0.06]). The Cohen’s d
contrasting the High Parasocial-High Social World and the Low
Parasocial-Low Social World contained the SESOI, and thus the results
were ambiguous (<em>d</em> = -0.20, 90%CI [-0.46, 0.06]; Figure
<a href="#fig:fig:s3-heart2-plot"><strong>??</strong></a> B). These results suggest that the main
effects of parasocial relationships and social world were theoretically
equivalent to zero.</p>

<p><strong>Exploratory Manipulation Check.</strong> To explore the effectiveness of the
parasocial relationship manipulation, I again used the procedure in
Study 2 to code the participants into three groups: “did not interact
with non-player characters” (Group 1), “interacted with non-player
characters but did not form parasocial relationships” (Group 2)“, and”interacted with non-player characters and formed parasocial
relationships" (Group 3). Then, I ran a two-way chi-square test
(Parasocial Relationships: High vs. Low x Groups: 1, 2, vs. 3) to
examine whether those in the social surrogacy essay condition (vs. the
non-social surrogacy condition) indicated they interacted with NPCs
(Group 2) and formed parasocial relationships (Group 3) more, rather
than they did not interact with non-player characters (Group 1). Results
did not show any differences in forming parasocial relatioships between
the Higher vs. Lower Parasocial Relationships conditions
(X<sup>2</sup>(2, <em>N</em> = 344) = 0.71, <em>p</em> = .699).</p>
<p>To explore the effectiveness of the social world manipulation, I ran
Welch’s <em>t</em>-test to compare the scores of the Single-Item Immersion
Scale (Reysen et al., 2019) and the on-the-fly measure of social world
between the High vs. Low social worlds conditions. Results showed that
participants in the Higher Social World condition reported similar
levels of immersion and social world compared with those in the Lower
Social World condition (for immersion, <em>t</em>(331.0) = -0.39, <em>p</em> = .700;
for social world measure, <em>t</em>(334.4) = 1.30, <em>p</em> = .193).</p>
<p>Overall the results of the exploratory manipulation check suggested that
the manipulations may not have affected the target constructs. As
planned, I treat the analyses as exploratory, and do not conclude the
effectiveness of the manipulation based on these analysis.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Enjoyment Across Conditions.</strong> I explored whether participants
reported different levels of enjoyment after playing the video game
across the condition using a 2 (Parsocial: Higher vs. Lower) x 2 (Social
World: Higher vs. Lower) ANOVA on enjoyment scores. Results showed no
main effect of Parasocial Relationships
(<em>F</em>(1, 338) = 1.08, <em>p</em> = .299), no main effect of Social World
(<em>F</em>(1, 338) = 0.32, <em>p</em> = .573), and no 2-way interaction bweten
Parasocial Relationships and Social World
(<em>F</em>(1, 338) = 0.23, <em>p</em> = .633) on enjoyment scores.
Thus, participant’s enjoyment did not differ depending on the parasocial
relationships content or the social world content in the video game.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Moderation Analysis.</strong> I explored whether the gender or
race of participants moderated the effect of the parasocial
relationships and the social worlds on belonging using regression
models. For each demographic characteristic, I constructed a regression
model predicting belonging with the following predictors: Parasocial
Relationships (.5 = high, -.5 = low), Social Worlds (.5 = high, -.5 =
low), Gender (.5 = female, -.5 = male) or Race (four dummy variables
representing: American-Indian, African American/Black, White/Caucasian,
Asian, Pacific Islander, and other), and their fully-crossed interaction
terms. For the moderation anaysis with gender, I did not find the main
effects (Parasocial Relationships:
<em>B</em> = -0.14, <em>SE</em> = 0.19, <em>t</em> = -0.78, <em>p</em> = .438, Social World:
<em>B</em> = -0.19, <em>SE</em> = 0.19, <em>t</em> = -1.00, <em>p</em> = .317, Gender:
<em>B</em> = -0.19, <em>SE</em> = 0.19, <em>t</em> = -1.00, <em>p</em> = .317), the 2-way interactions
(Parasocial Relationships x Gender:
<em>B</em> = 0.05, <em>SE</em> = 0.37, <em>t</em> = 0.13, <em>p</em> = .897; Social
World x Gender:
<em>B</em> = 0.15, <em>SE</em> = 0.37, <em>t</em> = 0.39, <em>p</em> = .696), or
the 3-way interaction among Parasocial Relationship, Social World, and
Gender
(<em>B</em> = -0.53, <em>SE</em> = 0.75, <em>t</em> = -0.71, <em>p</em> = .479).
For the moderation analysis with race, I did not find the main effects,
the 2-way interactions (Parasocial relationships x Social World,
Parasocial Relationships x Race, or Social World x Race), or the 3-way
interaction (Parasocial Relationships x Social World x Race). Note that
only few participants identified as non-White, and thus I was not able
to properly test the moderation by race in this study. Overall, these
results suggest that the effects of the parasocial relationship or
social world were not moderated by gender or racial identities.</p>

<p><strong>Player Character Identification</strong>. I explored whether participants
reported different levels of identifications with the player characters
across the higher vs. lower parasocial and social world conditions in a
2 (Parasocial Relationships: Higher vs. Lower) x 2 (Social World: Higher
vs. Lower) ANOVA. Results showed that all terms were null (the
parasocial relationships main effect:
<em>F</em>(1, 311) = 1.80, <em>p</em> = .181, the main effect of social world:
<em>F</em>(1, 311) = 0.06, <em>p</em> = .803; the interaction between
parasocial relationships and social world:
<em>F</em>(1, 311) = 0.34, <em>p</em> = .561). These results
suggest that participants reported similar levels of identification with
the player character (Higra) across the conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Moderation by Parasocial Relationships, Social World, Enjoyment, and
Player Character Identification</strong>. I explored whether measures of
parasocial relationship, social world, or enjoyment moderated the
effects of the social surrogacy essay manipulation on Heart Manikin a
series of mixed models. I constructed a mixed model for each moderator
variable (the manipulation check groups (Groups 1-3), Inclusion of the
Other in Self Scale, Single-Item Immersion Scale, and the On-The-Fly
Measure of Social World, the Enjoyment Scale, and the Player Character
Identification Scale) Thus, each model contained the following fixed
predictors: the moderator, Parasocial Relationships (higher vs. lower),
Social World (higher vs. lower), Time, the 2-way Moderator x Parasocial
Relationships, the 2-way Moderator x Social World interaction, the 2-way
Time x Parasocial Relationships, and the 2-way Time x Social World
interaction, the 3-way Moderator x Parasocial Relationships x Social
World interaction, and the 3-way Parasocial Relatioships x Social World
x Time. (Figure <a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>) Below, I only report positive
results (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) for the heart manikin here for brevity. Note that
these results were not preregistered and thus prone to Type I error.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Across all the models, I observed a main effect of time such that
participants reported lower Heart Manikin scores at Time 2 than Time 2,
consistent with the prior analysis.</p>
<p>For the analysis treating parasocial relationship group as a moderator,
I found the three-way interaction among parasocial relationships
condition, social world condition and time
(<em>B</em> = 0.13, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, <em>t</em> = 2.06, <em>p</em> = .040;
Figure <a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel A).
However, follow-up tests showed that the group means were not different
from each other.</p>
<p>For the analysis treating the Inclusion of the Other in Self as a
moderator, I found the main effect of the Inclusion of the Other in Self
scores (<em>B</em> = 0.13, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, <em>t</em> = 2.10, <em>p</em> = .037; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel B). These results suggest that
participants with higher Inclusion of the Other in Self scores reported
higher Heart Manikin sores across conditions and time.</p>
<p>For the analysis treating the Single-Item Immersion scale as a
moderator, I found the main effect of the immersion scores, such that
participants reporting higher immersion also reported higher belonging
(<em>B</em> = 0.23, <em>SE</em> = 0.05, <em>t</em> = 4.61, <em>p</em> &lt; .001; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel C). I found the two-way Immersion x
Parasocial Relationship Condition effect (
<em>B</em> = -0.11, <em>SE</em> = 0.05, <em>t</em> = -2.16, <em>p</em> = .032).
Follow-up tests suggested that the relationship between immersion and belonging was
greater in the low parasocial relationship condition than in the high parasocial relationship condition
(Low Parasocial Relationship Condition: <em>B</em> = 0.34, <em>SE</em> = 0.07, 95%CI[0.19, 0.48]; High Parasocial Relationship Condition: <em>B</em> = 0.12, <em>SE</em> = 0.07, 95%CI[-0.01, 0.25]).
I also found the two-way Immersion x Time
effect
(<em>B</em> = -0.11, <em>SE</em> = 0.02, <em>t</em> = -4.86, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).
Follow-up tests showed that the slope of immersion scores predicting
belonging was greater at Time 2 than at time 1 scores at Time 2 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = 0.12, <em>SE</em> = 0.05, 95%CI[0.01, 0.23]; Time 2: <em>B</em> = 0.34, <em>SE</em> = 0.05, 95%CI[0.23, 0.45]). I also found
the four-way Immersion x Parasocial Relationship x Social World x Time
interaction
(<em>B</em> = -0.07, <em>SE</em> = 0.02, <em>t</em> = -3.25, <em>p</em> = .001).
Follow-up tests suggested that, among the high parasocial and high
social world condition, the relationship between immersion and belonging
was greater at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = -0.03, <em>SE</em> = 0.10, 95%CI[-0.23, 0.16];
Time 2:
<em>B</em> = 0.35, <em>SE</em> = 0.10, 95%CI[0.16, 0.55]).</p>
<p>For the analysis treating the On-the-Fly Measure of Social World (OTF
Social World) as a moderator, I found the main effect of the On-the-Fly
Measure of Social World, such that participants reporting higher scores
of social world also reported higher belonging
(<em>B</em> = 0.29, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, <em>t</em> = 4.83, <em>p</em> &lt; .001; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel D). I also
found the main effect of social world, such that participants in the
high social world condition reported lower belonging than those in the
low social world condition
(<em>B</em> = -0.18, <em>SE</em> = 0.09, <em>t</em> = -1.97, <em>p</em> = .049). I also
observed the two-way OTF Social World x Time interaction
(<em>B</em> = 0.10, <em>SE</em> = 0.04, <em>t</em> = 2.41, <em>p</em> = .016). Follow-up tests
suggested that the relationship between the social world scores and
belonging was greater at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = 0.18, <em>SE</em> = 0.07, 95%CI[0.05, 0.31]; Time 2: <em>B</em> = 0.41, <em>SE</em> = 0.07, 95%CI[0.28, 0.54]).
Finally, I found the four-way Parasocial Relationships x Social World x
OTF Social World x Time interaction
(<em>B</em> = -0.06, <em>SE</em> = 0.03, <em>t</em> = -2.04, <em>p</em> = .042).
Follow-up tests suggested that, in the high parasocial and high social
world condition, the relationship between OTF Social World scores and
belonging was greater at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = 0.03, <em>SE</em> = 0.12, 95%CI[-0.20, 0.26];
Time 2:
<em>B</em> = 0.47, <em>SE</em> = 0.12, 95%CI[0.24, 0.70]).</p>
<p>For the analysis treating the enjoyment as a moderator, I found the main
effect of enjoyment, such that participants with higher scores of
enjoyment reported higher belonging
(<em>B</em> = 0.18, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, <em>t</em> = 3.11, <em>p</em> = .002; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel E). I also found the
2-way Enjoyment x Time interaction
(<em>B</em> = -0.15, <em>SE</em> = 0.02, <em>t</em> = -5.92, <em>p</em> &lt; .001). Follow-up
tests suggested that the relationship between enjoyment and belonging
was greater at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = 0.03, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, 95%CI[-0.09, 0.15]; Time 2:
<em>B</em> = 0.32, <em>SE</em> = 0.06, 95%CI[0.20, 0.44]). I also observed the four-way
Enjoyment x Parasocial Relationships x Socail World x Time interaction
(<em>B</em> = -0.08, <em>SE</em> = 0.02, <em>t</em> = -3.09, <em>p</em> = .002).
Follow-up tests showed that, in the low parasocial and low social world
condition, the relationship between enjoyment and belonging was greater
at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time 1:
<em>B</em> = -0.02, <em>SE</em> = 0.12, 95%CI[-0.25, 0.21];
Time 2:
<em>B</em> = 0.39, <em>SE</em> = 0.12, 95%CI[0.16, 0.62]).
The relationship between enjoyment and belonging in the low parasocial
and low social world at Time 2 was also greater than the relationship
between enjoyment and belonging in the high parasocial and low social
world condition at Time 1
(<em>B</em> = 0.39, <em>SE</em> = 0.12, 95%CI[0.16, 0.62]
vs.
<em>B</em> = -0.10, <em>SE</em> = 0.13, 95%CI[-0.34, 0.15]).</p>
<p>Lastly, for the analysis treating the identification with the player
character as a moderator, I found the main effect of the player character
identification, such that participants who identified more with the
player character reported higher belonging across conditions and time
(<em>B</em> = 0.35, <em>SE</em> = 0.10, <em>t</em> = 3.51, <em>p</em> &lt; .001; Figure
<a href="study-3-can-playing-a-single-player-video-game-replenish-belonging-via-parasocial-relationships-and-social-worlds.html#fig:s3-mod-plots">6.7</a>, Panel F). I
also found the main effect of Social World, such that participants in the
High Social World condition reported lower belonging
(<em>B</em> = -0.19, <em>SE</em> = 0.09, <em>t</em> = -2.02, <em>p</em> = .045). The two-way
player character identification x Parasocial Relationships was greater
than zero
(<em>B</em> = -0.30, <em>SE</em> = 0.10, <em>t</em> = -2.99, <em>p</em> = .003).
Follow-up tests suggested that the relationship between player character
identification and belonging was greater in the low parasocial condition
than in the high parasocial condition (low parasocial condition:
<em>B</em> = 0.65, <em>SE</em> = 0.15, 95%CI[0.36, 0.95]; high parasocial
condition: <em>B</em> = 0.05, <em>SE</em> = 0.13, 95%CI[-0.21, 0.32]). I also
found the two-way Player Character Identification x Time interaction
(<em>B</em> = -0.15, <em>SE</em> = 0.05, <em>t</em> = -3.27, <em>p</em> = .001).
Follow-up tests suggested that the relationship between player character
identification and belonging was stronger at Time 2 than at Time 1 (Time
1: <em>B</em> = 0.20, <em>SE</em> = 0.11, 95%CI[-0.02, 0.42]; Time 2:
<em>B</em> = 0.51, <em>SE</em> = 0.11, 95%CI[0.29, 0.72]).</p>
<p><strong>Bivariate Correltion Analysis</strong>. I explored associations among the
measured variables via bivariate correlations. I only report select
positive associations here. For the full correlation matrix, see Table
<a href="supplementary-figures-and-analyses-by-study.html#tab:appendix-s3-correlations-table">B.7</a> in [Appendix]. Note that these
analyses were not planned a priori, and prone to Type I error. At Time
2, participants with higher Heart Manikin scores reported higher
parasocial relatioships, immersion, social world, player character
identification, and enjoyment, compared with those with lower Heart
Manikin scores. Measures of parasocial relationships, immersion, social
world, player character identification, and enjoyment were positively
correlated with each other.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>In Study 3, I tested whether playing a video game with higher parasocial
relationships and higher social worlds could increase belonging
following social rejection (Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4). Results did not
support these hypothesis. Rejected participants reported similar levels
of belonging regardless of the levels of exposure to the parasocial
relationships content and the social world content in the video game.
The current null results imply many possibilities: (a) failure of
manipulating parasocial relationships and social worlds, (b) failure of
inducing social rejection, (c) time passed from social rejection simply
recovering belonging, and (d) stressors and distractions during the
COVID-19 pandemic reducing the effectiveness of the rejection induction
and the social surrogacy manipulations.</p>
<p><strong>Failure of Manipulating Parasocial Relationships and Social Worlds</strong>
We can possibly attribute the current results to ineffective
manipulations for the parasocial relationships and social worlds.
Results of the exploratory manipulation check supports this notion.
Regardless of their parasocial condition, participants reported similar
levels of experiencing parasocial relationships. Similarly, participants
reported similar levels of social world regardless of the social world
conditions (higher vs lower). As planned, I refrain from making a
conclusion about the effectiveness of the manipulations since the
manipulation check measures were not validated to measure parasocial
relationships and social worlds, as mentioned previously. Still, these
null results highlight the possibility of the failure of the
manipulations.</p>
<p>In retrospect, a better approach would have been to validate the
effectiveness of the video game manipulation with the social world. That
said, these measures have never been used to validate the effectiveness
of a manipulation for parasocial relationships and social world, and
thus the true effectiveness of the current manipulation remains
ambiguous. Future studies should develop effective measures of prosocial
relationships and social world, and then use them to validate
manipulations.</p>
<p><strong>Failure of Inducing Social Rejection.</strong> Consistent with the
possibility discussed in Study 2, the rejection manipulation could have
been ineffective to begin with, and thus the current study failed to
capture any effects of recovering belonging. Again, I suggest that this
possibility is unlikely since the rejection manipulation was shown to be
effective, as discussed in Study 2.</p>
<p><strong>Time from Rejection Induction</strong> Participants played the video game on
the average of 30.48 minutes
(<em>M</em> = 30.48, <em>SD</em> = 63.69). One possibility is that all participants
replenished their belonging while playing the video game, regardless of
their parasocial relationships and social world content. If this is the
case, participants would report similar levels of belonging before
writing the rejection essay and after playing the video game. However,
the results do not support this notion. Instead, participants felt less
belonging after playing a game (Time 2) than their baseline (Time 1). I
cannot conclude whether passage of time replenished everyone’s belonging
based on the current results.</p>
<p><strong>Negative Effect of Video Game on Belonging</strong>. One possibility remains
that the video game had a negative, not a positive, effect on belonging.
Again, participants reported lower belonging after playing the video
game (Time 2) than baseline. I speculate two possibilities for the
lowered belonging: (a) frustrations in playing a new game, and (b)
fighting with enemies.</p>
<p>I speculate that some participants may have experienced frustrations in
completing the game (e.g., difficulty in controls) since everyone played
the game for the first time. As a result, participants may have
experienced lowered sense of control. Since people with lowered sense of
control can experience lowered belonging, participants who experienced
difficulty playing the game could have experienced lowered sense of
belonging <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I also speculate that the battles in the game may have had an adverse
influence to a sense of belonging. The role-playing games on the market
usually contain contents of fighting against enemies. Thus, I included
battles in the game to make the current video game representative of
other games on the market. However, battles involve defeating monsters
and key enemy figures, akin to aggressive, antisocial behaviors that
usually reduce belonging. Some participants may have found it aversive
to defeat enemies in the game, especially if they liked the enemy
characters, eventually lowering their sense of belonging.</p>
<p><strong>Participants Meta-Experience of the Study due to Pandemic</strong>.
Participants in the current study participated in the study online
during the COVID-19 pandemic (participation date ranging from
March, 2021 to
April, 2021). One possibility of
the null result can be that the basal stresses and social isolation
during the pandemic is so prominent that the social surrogacy
manipulation deemed ineffective, resulting in everyone feeling rejected
regardless of the exposure to social surrogacy. Another possibility is
that these pandemic-related stresses distracted participants from paying
attention in the game, resulting in ineffective manipulations of
parasocial relationships and social worlds. Although I excluded any
participants who failed attention check, these pandemic-related stresses
and distractions might have made participants less affected by the
social surrogacy presented in the manipulations. Overall, I suggest that
we interpret the current results with a caveat that the data collection
happened during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Overall, results of Study 3 suggested that rejected participants did not
replenish belonging after playing a video game, regardless of their
content of parasocial relationships or social world. These results are
inconsistent with the social surrogacy hypothesis suggesting that
parasocial relationships and social world can replenish belonging. I
speculate that the inconsistencies might stem from the failure of
manipulation social surrogacy (parasocial relationships and social
world), the failure of social rejection, time from rejection experience,
the video game’s negative effect on belonging, and the participants’
experience of the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
