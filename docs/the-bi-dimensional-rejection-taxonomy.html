<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The Bi-Dimensional Rejection Taxonomy</h1>
<p>This chapter has been published as, Sunami, N., Nadzan, M. A., &amp;
Jaremka, L. M. (2019). The bi‐dimensional rejection taxonomy: Organizing
responses to interpersonal rejection along antisocial–prosocial and
engaged–disengaged dimensions. Social and Personality Psychology

<p>Responses to interpersonal rejection vary widely in form and function.
Existing theories of interpersonal rejection have exclusively focused on
organizing these responses on a single antisocial–prosocial dimension.
Accumulating evidence suggests a gap in this approach: variability in
social responses to rejection cannot solely be explained by the
antisocial–prosocial dimension alone. To fill this gap, we propose the
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy, consisting of the
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and engaged-disengaged <em>y</em>-axis, a novel
contribution to the literature. We demonstrate that both the <em>x</em>- and
<em>y</em>-axes are necessary for understanding interpersonal responses to
rejection and avoiding erroneous conclusions. We also show how this new
framework allows researchers to generate more nuanced and accurate
hypotheses about how people respond when rejected. We further
demonstrate how existing research about individual differences and
situational factors that predict responses to rejection can be viewed in
a new light within the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. We conclude by
suggesting how the taxonomy inspires innovative questions for future
research.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<p>Traveling with an incomplete map is not very efficient—a traveler may
end up in the wrong place because they are unsure where they are going.
This analogy can also be applied to scientific research—a researcher
is likely to arrive at an incorrect conclusion because they are using an
incomplete theoretical framework. In this paper, we suggest that the
rejection literature is operating with an incomplete theoretical
framework for understanding responses to interpersonal rejection.
Existing theories have already advanced our understanding of how people
respond to rejection, primarily focusing on a single
antisocial–prosocial dimension. Although this dimension is important,
we suggest that not all antisocial and prosocial responses are
identical. To account for this unexplained variability, we incorporate a
second dimension, the engaged–disengaged dimension, adopted from the
coping literature <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-carverPersonalityCoping2010" role="doc-biblioref">Carver &amp; Connor-Smith, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-dijkstraEngagingRatherDisengaging2016" role="doc-biblioref">Dijkstra &amp; Homan, 2016</a>)</span>. Accordingly, we propose
the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy, consisting of an
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and an engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis
(Figure <a href="the-bi-dimensional-rejection-taxonomy.html#fig:bidr-all">2.1</a>). Adding this second dimension provides a
more thorough theoretical framework for understanding responses to
rejection, equipping researchers with a more complete map for generating
new hypotheses.</p>

</div>
<p>Our new taxonomy benefits the rejection literature in three ways. First,
it provides a unified map for researchers to organize belonging-relevant
responses to interpersonal rejection. Without this map, researchers
would solely rely on the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis, leading to
inaccurate conclusions about rejection-elicited responses, as
highlighted throughout the paper. For example, if a researcher only
assessed engaged prosocial responses to rejection, and rejected
participants didn’t preferentially display these responses, the
researcher might erroneously conclude that rejection doesn’t lead to
prosocial responses at all. Using the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy,
we can see that rejected participants could still display prosocial
behavior, but in a disengaged manner. Thus, the engaged–disengaged
<em>y</em>-axis of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy creates a cohesive
framework, preventing researchers from reaching inaccurate conclusions
about rejection-elicited responses.</p>
<p>Second, having a bi-dimensional framework allows researchers to generate
more nuanced and accurate predictions about responses to rejection. In
the past, researchers focused exclusively on how rejection affected
antisocial and prosocial behavior (the <em>x</em>-axis) without differentiating
types of behavior within these categories. As a result, existing
hypotheses were limited in specificity. With the bi-dimensional
rejection taxonomy, researchers can generate more nuanced and innovative
hypotheses that incorporate both the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and
the engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis. For example, without the taxonomy, a
researcher might hypothesize that both Situation A and Situation B lead
to prosocial responses following rejection. However, with the new
taxonomy, researchers can hypothesize that Situation A leads to engaged
prosocial responses (e.g., reaching out to close others for connection),
whereas Situation B leads to disengaged prosocial responses (e.g.,
watching their favorite TV program to feel socially connected). This
hypothesis highlights potential differences between Situation A and B
that would not be apparent without the taxonomy. Thus, the taxonomy arms
researchers with a comprehensive framework of potential response
options. Researchers can then use existing theoretical and empirical
work to generate more nuanced and accurate hypotheses.</p>
<p>Third, the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy highlights types of
responses that are understudied in the rejection literature. As we
discuss later, the bulk of rejection research has focused on engaged
antisocial and prosocial responses. Using the lens of the bi-dimensional
rejection taxonomy, we can see that many disengaged responses are yet to
be examined in the context of rejection, highlighting the need for
further research.</p>
<p>In proposing the taxonomy, we rely on existing work demonstrating that
self-protective and belonging needs are fundamental to human nature, and
that interpersonal rejection threatens these needs, motivating
behavioral responses <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-baumeisterNeedBelongDesire1995" role="doc-biblioref">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-maslow1943" role="doc-biblioref">Maslow, 1943</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-murray2008" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2008a</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>. Throughout this paper, we use
interpersonal rejection as an overarching phrase that encompasses
threats to belonging, including social exclusion, social rejection,
ostracism, and relational devaluation—referring to experiences when a
person feels like they aren’t loved, cared for, or accepted
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-learySelfesteemInterpersonalMonitor1995" role="doc-biblioref">Leary et al., 1995</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We exclusively focus on responses to rejection that are purposeful and
voluntary (in contrast to automatic and involuntary responses) since our
goal is to describe how people cope with rejection. This focus is
consistent with the coping literature (on which the <em>y</em>-axis is heavily
based) that defines coping as purposeful and conscious attempts to deal
with the stressor <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-connor-smithResponsesStressAdolescence2000" role="doc-biblioref">Connor-Smith et al., 2000</a>)</span>.
Automatic or involuntary responses (e.g., attentional bias to smiling
faces) are outside the scope of the taxonomy and thus outside the scope
of this paper.</p>
<p>We divide the current paper into two parts. In the first half, we review
previous research supporting the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and
introduce a novel engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis. In the second half, we
highlight how the taxonomy allows researchers to see existing published

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Foundational Theories in the Rejection Literature</h3>
<p>The antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis of the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy stems from prior empirical research demonstrating that
rejection sometimes leads to antisocial behavior and, at other times,
prosocial behavior <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-dewall2009" role="doc-biblioref">DeWall et al., 2009</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-dewall2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010a</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-romero-canyasPayingBelongWhen2010" role="doc-biblioref">Romero-Canyas et al., 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-twenge2001" role="doc-biblioref">Twenge et al., 2001</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-warburton2006" role="doc-biblioref">Warburton et al., 2006a</a>)</span>. For
example, rejected participants blasted louder and longer noise to a
stranger in one study [an antisocial response; <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-twenge2001" role="doc-biblioref">Twenge et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-twenge2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>] and worked
harder on a collective task in another study [a prosocial response;
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-williams1997" role="doc-biblioref">Williams &amp; Sommer</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-williams1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>] compared with non-rejected participants. Rejection
scholars have developed multiple theoretical frameworks for
understanding these interpersonal responses to rejection that fall along
the antisocial-prosocial <em>x</em>-axis. We refer readers to other theoretical
papers for more extensive discussions of this dimension <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span> and summarize relevant theories here to support the
antisocial-prosocial <em>x</em>-axis of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy.</p>
<p>Many previous theories commonly highlight the existence of the
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis. For example, the multimotive model
defines antisocial responses as those that function to diminish
belonging whereas prosocial responses as those that function to enhance
belonging <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>)</span>. The need-threat model also identifies
aggression (antisocial responses) and prosocial responses as primary
categories of responses to cope with interpersonal rejection
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>. Similarly, the reconnection hypothesis and the resource
redistribution model both agree that responses to rejection range in
function from antisocial to prosocial <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-dewall2011" role="doc-biblioref">DeWall &amp; Richman, 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-shilling2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shilling &amp; Brown, 2015</a>)</span>.
These theories all agree that motives to self-protect or regain control
predict antisocial responses, and motives to obtain belonging predict
prosocial responses <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-dewall2011" role="doc-biblioref">DeWall &amp; Richman, 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-shilling2015" role="doc-biblioref">Shilling &amp; Brown, 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>. In sum,
rejection theories strongly support the existence of the
antisocial–prosocial dimension.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Foundational Theories in the Close Relationships Literature</h3>
<p>Close relationships researchers also support the existence of an
antisocial-prosocial <em>x</em>-axis. For instance, the investment model
suggests that responses to relationship decline within a romantic
relationship (a form of perceived rejection) can range from destructive
(e.g., relationship-damaging responses such as leaving the relationship;
similar to antisocial behavior) to constructive [e.g.,
relationship-repairing responses such as voicing a concern; similar to
prosocial behavior; <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-rusbult1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-rusbult1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982a</a>)</span>]. Similarly, risk regulation theory
suggests that couples’ responses towards each other function to promote
or damage the relationships <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayOptimizingAssuranceRisk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2006</a>)</span>, akin to antisocial and
prosocial behavior within the romantic relationship.</p>
<p>The rapid marital coding system (RMICS) also supports the existence of
the antisocial-prosocial <em>x</em>-axis. The RMICS describes behaviors that
partners display towards each other on a continuum ranging from
hostility to positivity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-heyman2004" role="doc-biblioref">Heyman, 2004</a>)</span>. On the left end of the continuum,
hostile responses function to reduce connection between partners,
similar to antisocial responses. On the right side of the continuum,
positive responses function to increase connection between partners,
similar to prosocial responses.</p>
<p>These close relationships theories strongly support the existence of the
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis. This dimension has been identified in
different terms: destructive–constructive in the investment model
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rusbult1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al., 1982a</a>)</span>, self-protection–relationship promotion in risk
regulation theory <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayOptimizingAssuranceRisk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2006</a>)</span>, and hostilit<em>y</em>–positivity in the
RMICS <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-heyman2004" role="doc-biblioref">Heyman, 2004</a>)</span>. However, all of the terms reflect the same
underlying concept of behaviors that reduce (antisocial) or increase
(prosocial) connection with others. In addition, similar to the
rejection literature, risk regulation theory argues that antisocial
behaviors are motivated by self-protection concerns whereas prosocial
responses are motivated by belonging needs <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayOptimizingAssuranceRisk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2006</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Defining Antisocial and Prosocial Responses</h3>
<p>As discussed above, multiple theories in the rejection and close
relationships literatures strongly support an antisocial–prosocial
dimension for understanding interpersonal responses to rejection. This
consensus provides a strong foundation for the <em>x</em>-axis in the
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. All theories consistently discuss how
antisocial responses function to reduce social connection between the
self and others, motivated by self-protection needs, and how prosocial
responses function to promote social connection, motivated by belonging
needs. Accordingly, we adopt these definitions in the bi-dimensional
rejection taxonomy. Telling someone “I hate you” would thus be an
antisocial response because it functions to reduce social connection
with the other person. On the other hand, telling someone “I love you”
would be a prosocial response because it functions to promote social
connection.</p>
<p>Note that the word prosocial is sometimes used to denote altruistic
behaviors that benefit the welfare of others—these behaviors may or
may not function to promote connection with others
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-batsonAltruismProsocialBehavior2003" role="doc-biblioref">Batson &amp; Powell, 2003</a>)</span>. In this paper, we use the label
prosocial to refer to behaviors that promote social connection with
others, consistent with typical uses of the word in rejection research

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> A New Dimension: The Engaged–Disengaged <em>y</em>-Axis</h2>
<p>A close inspection of existing empirical work reveals that there is
significant variability within antisocial and prosocial
responses—reflecting heterogeneous strategies for responding to
interpersonal rejection. For example, prior research demonstrated that
rejection sometimes leads to direct and active attempts to connect with
others [e.g., spending money to garner acceptance from others;
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-manerDoesSocialExclusion2007" role="doc-biblioref">Maner et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-manerDoesSocialExclusion2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>; <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-romero-canyasPayingBelongWhen2010" role="doc-biblioref">Romero-Canyas et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-romero-canyasPayingBelongWhen2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>]. At
other times, rejection leads to indirect and passive attempts to connect
with others [e.g., experiencing nostalgia;
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-derrickSocialSurrogacyHow2009" role="doc-biblioref">Derrick et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-derrickSocialSurrogacyHow2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>]. No existing theories of interpersonal
rejection can distinguish between these varied responses—both types of
responses are categorized as prosocial in the context of existing
theories. The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy makes a novel claim that
the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis captures only one dimension of
responses, and that a new dimension is needed to fully understand
responses to rejection. In this section, we first review foundational
theories that suggest an additional possible dimension. Then, we define
our new engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis at the end of this section.</p>
<div id="foundational-theories" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Foundational Theories</h3>
<p>To understand the variation within antisocial and prosocial responses,
we rely on theoretical and empirical work in the coping literature. This
extensive literature describes the ways in which people cope with (i.e.,
voluntarily and purposefully respond to) stressors; thus, this
literature provides a rich foundation for building our <em>y</em>-axis.</p>
<p>Coping researchers have proposed various ways to classify coping
responses, including emotion-focused, problem-focused, proactive, and
meaning-focused coping <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aspinwallStitchTimeSelfregulation1997" role="doc-biblioref">Aspinwall &amp; Taylor, 1997</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-lazarusStressAppraisalCoping1984" role="doc-biblioref">R. S. Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-skinnerSearchingStructureCoping2003" role="doc-biblioref">Skinner et al., 2003</a>)</span>. Using factor analyses and
theoretical discussions, researchers identified an engaged–disengaged
dimension as the critical factor underlying the majority of coping
responses <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-carverPersonalityCoping2010" role="doc-biblioref">Carver &amp; Connor-Smith, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-compasEffortfulInvoluntaryResponses1997" role="doc-biblioref">Compas et al., 1997</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-connor-smithResponsesStressAdolescence2000" role="doc-biblioref">Connor-Smith et al., 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-dijkstraEngagingRatherDisengaging2016" role="doc-biblioref">Dijkstra &amp; Homan, 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-scheierCopingStressDivergent1986" role="doc-biblioref">Scheier et al., 1986</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-skinnerSearchingStructureCoping2003" role="doc-biblioref">Skinner et al., 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-tobinHierarchicalFactorStructure1989" role="doc-biblioref">Tobin et al., 1989</a>)</span>. According to this literature,
engaged coping strategies are direct and active behaviors that confront
the stressor with a “hands-on” approach. A person has used an engaged
coping strategy when they act out their frustrations on others (e.g.,
aggression), seek social support, or behave in other active and direct
ways <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-carverPersonalityCoping2010" role="doc-biblioref">Carver &amp; Connor-Smith, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-dijkstraEngagingRatherDisengaging2016" role="doc-biblioref">Dijkstra &amp; Homan, 2016</a>)</span>. On the other hand, disengaged
coping strategies refer to indirect and passive behaviors that aim to
avoid the stressor. Examples of disengaged coping are social withdrawal,
denial, and wishful thinking <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-carverPersonalityCoping2010" role="doc-biblioref">Carver &amp; Connor-Smith, 2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We can easily apply the distinction between engaged and disengaged
coping to understand how people respond to interpersonal rejection. In
the context of rejection, the stressor that people are coping with is
the threat to belonging and self-protection/control experienced by the
rejected person. As noted earlier, these need-threats are
well-documented consequences of experiencing rejection
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>. The threats to belonging or
self-protection/control can be present-oriented, when a person is trying
to cope with the current need-threat, or it can be future-oriented, when
a person is trying to pre-emptively cope with a potential future
need-threat. In coping with those stressors, people can respond in ways
that are more engaged versus disengaged. We adopt these ideas in
defining the <em>y</em>-axis, as described in the next section.</p>
<p>Although no past theories have explicitly differentiated responses to
rejection as engaged or disengaged, some researchers have implied the
existence of this distinction by separating social withdrawal from other
antisocial responses. For example, the multimotive model identifies
social withdrawal as a subtype of antisocial (belonging-diminishing)
responses that are separate from more overt antisocial responses such as
aggression <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>)</span>.
Attachment theory also differentiated social withdrawal from other overt
forms of behavior (e.g., aggression) as a response to prolonged
rejection from an attachment figure <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bowlbySeparationAnxietyAnger2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bowlby, 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-horneyNeuroticPersonalityOur1964" role="doc-biblioref">Horney, 1964</a>)</span>. These theories both support the
distinction proposed by the coping literature: disengaged antisocial
responses are different from engaged antisocial responses. As we
describe later, a benefit of formally defining the engaged–disengaged
<em>y</em>-axis is that it highlights additional forms of disengaged antisocial
responses that have been neglected by existing theories.</p>
<p>Another theory that supports differentiating antisocial and prosocial
responses is the investment model, a widel<em>y</em>-used theoretical model in
the romantic relationships literature. The investment model uses a
two-dimensional space, characterizing how romantic partners behave when
their romantic relationship is in decline <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rusbultExitVoiceLoyalty1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al., 1982b</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-rusbultResponsesDissatisfactionClose1987" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult, 1987</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-rusbultInterdependenceAnalysisAccommodation1991" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult &amp; Verette, 1991</a>)</span>. Specifically, the investment
model proposes the destructive–constructive dimension (similar to our
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis, as described previously) and the
active–passive dimension (similar to, but also different from, our
engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis). Before discussing similarities and
differences between the multimotive model, the investment model, and our
new taxonomy, we first define the disengaged–engaged <em>y</em>-axis so that
the reader has a complete understanding of these terms. Then, in the
following section, we discuss how our model contributes over and above
existing work in advancing our understanding of responses to
interpersonal rejection.</p>
</div>
<div id="defining-engageddisengaged-responses-to-rejection" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Defining Engaged–Disengaged Responses to Rejection</h3>
<p>Based on the literature reviewed above, we propose the
engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis that describes whether a response to
rejection represents an engaged or disengaged attempt to cope with the
stressor. Again, the stressor in the context of rejection is the current
or future need-threat [i.e., the threat to self-protection/control or
affiliation needs; <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-baumeisterNeedBelongDesire1995" role="doc-biblioref">Baumeister &amp; Leary</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-baumeisterNeedBelongDesire1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>;
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>]. We define engaged responses
as direct and active attempts to deal with the stressor. They are
“hands-on,” approach-based strategies to confront and face the stressor.
An example of an engaged antisocial response is behaving aggressively
towards one’s romantic partner, because exerting control over one’s
partner actively and directly replenishes the sense of
self-protection/control thwarted by rejection. An example of an engaged
prosocial response is seeking support from a loved one because this
response actively and directly replenishes the sense of belonging
thwarted by rejection <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayWhenRejectionStings2002" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2002</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-murrayBalancingConnectednessSelfprotection2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast, we define disengaged responses as indirect and passive
attempts to handle the stressor. They are “hands-off,” avoidance-based
strategies to evade and divert from the stressor. These responses help
to avoid threats to belonging or self-protection/control. An example of
a disengaged antisocial response is social withdrawal, because
withdrawing is a hands-off strategy that allows a person to avoid
further rejection (and thus further threats to belonging or
self-protection/control). An example of a disengaged prosocial response
is relying on social surrogates (e.g., parasocial relationships)—such
as watching one’s favorite TV show or passively browsing social media to
obtain social connection. This qualifies as disengaged because social
surrogates allow people to passively and indirectly replenish belonging
while avoiding future rejection.</p>
<p>Importantly, the engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis is defined by whether the
response itself is engaged (direct, active, hands-on) or disengaged
(indirect, passive, hands-off); it is not defined by the situation or
environment in which it occurs. At the same time, recognizing the
situation in which the response occurs is important because the
situation limits possible response options. In a person’s da<em>y</em>-to-day
life, there is often a lot of flexibility in responding. For example, a
rejected person can choose whether to seek social support (an engaged
response) or watch their favorite TV show (a disengaged response) even
if they are in the same situation (e.g., at home with their romantic
partner on a Friday after work). This response flexibility is usually
absent among lab studies where participants are given only one option to
respond (e.g., participating in a noise blast task and deciding how much
noise to blast, but not being given any other response options). Thus,
the situation has the potential to constrain responses to be either
engaged or disengaged, especially in laboratory studies. Using the
engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis, researchers can design studies that
include diverse response options, as we highlight in the future
directions section towards the end of the paper.</p>
<p>Together with the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis, the
engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis completes the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy. These two dimensions both describe the function of a given
response: whether a response functions to reduce or promote connection
(<em>x</em>-axis) and whether a response functions as a direct, active,
hands-on way of coping versus an indirect, passive, hands-off way of
coping with the stressor (<em>y</em>-axis). In the next section, we discuss how
the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy compares with the existing
theories of social behavior. Then, we provide examples of responses
within each quadrant, demonstrating how the two dimensions are
independent from each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="comparisons-with-existing-theories" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Comparisons with Existing Theories</h2>
<p>The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy provides a novel lens through
which to view responses to rejection, incorporating both the
antisocial–prosocial and engaged–disengaged dimensions. How does the
taxonomy compare with other theories? In this section, we discuss the
advantages of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy over existing
theories in the rejection and close relationships literatures.</p>
<p>Compared with existing rejection theories, the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy provides a more nuanced and accurate depiction of responses to
interpersonal rejection. The main advantage of the taxonomy is its power
to differentiate engaged and disengaged responses, particularly
prosocial responses. Past literature showed that rejected people respond
in ways that qualify as disengaged and prosocial, such as thinking about
one’s favorite TV program <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-derrickSocialSurrogacyHow2009" role="doc-biblioref">Derrick et al., 2009</a>)</span> and
that people can fulfill belonging in a variety of ways, including via
social surrogates (e.g., a fictional character; Gabriel &amp; Valenti,
2017). However, no existing theories have formally differentiated these
types of prosocial responses from other more engaged responses (e.g.,
seeking social support from a loved one; Murray et al., 2008). The
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy also differentiates disengaged
antisocial responses. Among disengaged responses, social withdrawal is
the only form of disengaged antisocial responses currently described by
existing rejection theories, such as the multimotive model
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>)</span>. With the current
taxonomy, we can see that there are additional types of disengaged
antisocial responses not described by the multimotive model or any other
existing theory (e.g., passive aggressive behavior, as we describe in
detail later). The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy thus accounts for
more responses than any other framework available in the rejection
literature.</p>
<p>The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy also offers advantages over the
investment model in the close relationships literature. The investment
model suggests that responses to romantic relationship decline range
along a two-dimensional space: the destructive–constructive (i.e., how
a response damages or nurtures the romantic relationship) and
active–passive (i.e., how a response overtly or indirectly affects the
romantic relationship) dimensions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rusbultExitVoiceLoyalty1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al., 1982b</a>)</span>. On the
surface, the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy seems similar to the
investment model. However, the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy is more
advantageous than the investment model in considering broader sources of
rejection and targets of the response. The investment model
characterizes situations when the romantic relationship partner is the
source of relationship decline, and it only characterizes responses
towards an existing relationship partner <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rusbultExitVoiceLoyalty1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al., 1982b</a>)</span>.
The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy captures threats to belonging from
any source while also characterizing responses towards any target, not
just the romantic partner. Finally, the engaged-disengaged <em>y</em>-axis of
the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy more accurately captures variation
among antisocial and prosocial responses evident in the rejection
literature. Whereas saying “I hate you” to one’s partner is a passive
response (on the bottom half of the <em>y</em>-axis) according to the
investment model <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rusbultExitVoiceLoyalty1982" role="doc-biblioref">Rusbult et al., 1982b</a>)</span>, this behavior would
quality as engaged (on the top half of the <em>y</em>-axis) according to the
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. The <em>y</em>-axis of the taxonomy is
founded on decades of work in the coping literature

<p>In the previous sections, we reviewed literature supporting the
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and introduced the engaged-disengaged
<em>y</em>-axis to the rejection literature. We also compared this taxonomy
with existing theories, and demonstrated that the taxonomy presents many
advantages. In this section, we discuss select evidence demonstrating
that interpersonal responses to rejection can be plotted in this
two-dimensional space, broadly categorized into four quadrants: engaged
antisocial responses (Quadrant 1), engaged prosocial responses (Quadrant
2), disengaged antisocial responses (Quadrant 3), and disengaged
prosocial responses (Quadrant 4). We present a hypothetical exemplar for
each dimension in <a href="the-bi-dimensional-rejection-taxonomy.html#fig:bidr-exemplars">2.2</a> to illustrate the
differences among quadrants and help the reader understand each
quadrant. We also discuss existing research that falls into each
quadrant in this section. Since no past studies included both of these
new dimensions in their studies, we infer which quadrant a response
falls into based on the properties of the response. We begin by
reviewing existing empirical work that falls into Quadrant 1, and then
move to Quadrants 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy highlights types of responses that
have been understudied in the literature (e.g., passive aggressive
behavior and nostalgia). To better illustrate these new kinds of
responses, we discuss multiple examples for Quadrants 3 and 4 (i.e.,
disengaged antisocial and prosocial responses). Since past literature
has extensively discussed responses in Quadrant 1 and Quadrant 2 (i.e.,
engaged antisocial and prosocial responses, as discussed above), we
highlight only one representative example for these quadrants.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Responses in Quadrant 1: Engaged Antisocial Responses</h3>
<p>Past studies have demonstrated that rejected people respond in ways that
qualify as engaged and antisocial. For example, rejected people
allocated more hot sauce to a bystander who disliked spicy food,
compared with non-rejected people
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aydukIndividualDifferencesRejection2008" role="doc-biblioref">Ayduk et al., 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-dewallLittleAcceptanceGoes2010" role="doc-biblioref">DeWall et al., 2010b</a>)</span>. This response is antisocial because it
functions to reduce connection with others

because it is a hands-on, approach-based and direct attempt to
re-establish threatened self-protection/control needs by exercising
dominance or control over others <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-warburtonWhenOstracismLeads2006" role="doc-biblioref">Warburton et al., 2006b</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Responses in Quadrant 2: Engaged Prosocial Responses</h3>
<p>Past studies showed that people seek their romantic partner’s support
when faced with potential rejection from that partner, especially among
people with higher self-esteem
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayWhenRejectionStings2002" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2002</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-murrayBalancingConnectednessSelfprotection2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008b</a>)</span>. Applying our proposed taxonomy, we
suggest that this behavior qualifies as an engaged prosocial response
because seeking social support from a romantic partner functions to
increase social connection (a prosocial response) and actively confronts
the current threat to belonging by directly seeking social connection.</p>
</div>
<div id="responses-in-quadrant-3-disengaged-antisocial-responses" class="section level3" number="2.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Responses in Quadrant 3: Disengaged Antisocial Responses</h3>
<p>One advantage of the taxonomy is that it highlights disengaged
antisocial responses that are not accounted for by existing theories; we
discuss several examples within this quadrant. Compared with
non-rejected participants, rejected participants desired to withdraw
from subsequent social interactions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-renEvidenceAnotherResponse2015" role="doc-biblioref">Ren et al., 2015</a>)</span>.
This response functions to reduce social connection by avoiding further
social contact. In light of our taxonomy, they are disengaged responses
because they avoid future threats to belonging and
self-protection/control by isolating oneself from others.</p>
<p>In addition to withdrawing socially, rejected people can structure their
environment to prevent social encounters. For instance, rejected people
preferred room configurations that hindered social interactions,
presumably to avoid interacting with other people
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-meagherSeekingSafetySociofugal2017" role="doc-biblioref">Meagher &amp; Marsh, 2017</a>)</span>. This response is antisocial since
doing so reduces opportunities for social connection, and the response
is disengaged since it functions to evade future belonging threats.</p>
<p>Another example of a disengaged antisocial response is being
passive-aggressive by not engaging in a behavior that can prevent harm
to another person <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-parrottAddressingCriterionProblem2007" role="doc-biblioref">Parrott &amp; Giancola, 2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-southrichardsonEverydayAggressionTakes2014" role="doc-biblioref">South Richardson, 2014</a>)</span>. For example, a rejected
person might intentionally not speak up to defend their partner when the
partner is insulted by others. This behavior is antisocial since doing
so reduces connection with the partner. It is also a disengaged response
since passive forms of aggression are “hands-off” and indirect means of
dealing with the stressor.</p>
<p>People who feel socially rejected are more prone to stop caring for
themselves by neglecting basic needs, a behavior called self-neglect,
another form of a disengaged antisocial response. Self-neglect refers to
inattention to personal hygiene and health (e.g., not showering or
wearing deodorant), often accompanied by behaviors such as hoarding and
refusal of help from others
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-abramsPredictorsSelfNeglectCommunityDwelling2002" role="doc-biblioref">Abrams et al., 2002</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-dongCrosssectionalPopulationbasedStudy2010" role="doc-biblioref">Dong et al., 2010</a>)</span>. People who engage in
self-neglecting behavior often report desires to avoid losing control
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-band-wintersteinElderSelfNeglect2012" role="doc-biblioref">Band-Winterstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-bozinovskiOlderSelfNeglectersInterpersonal2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bozinovski, 2000</a>)</span>. Thus, self-neglect is
a disengaged antisocial response because neglecting one’s hygiene or
habitat functions to reduce social connection with others, and it is an
indirect and passive way to avoid future threat to
self-protection/control needs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Responses in Quadrant 4: Disengaged Prosocial Responses</h3>
<p>Many disengaged prosocial responses involve the use of social
surrogates—human or non-human targets with a psychological, but not
physical, connection <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gabrielSocialSurrogatesSocial2016" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel et al., 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gabrielSocialSurrogatesRejection2017" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel &amp; Valenti, 2017a</a>)</span>.

obtain belonging <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-gabrielSocialSurrogatesSocial2016" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel et al., 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gabrielSocialSurrogatesRejection2017" role="doc-biblioref">Gabriel &amp; Valenti, 2017a</a>)</span>. For example, remembering a fight
with a close other (i.e., perceived rejection) led people to think
longer about their favorite TV program (vs. a non-favorite TV program),
interpreted as a prosocial attempt to restore belonging
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-derrickSocialSurrogacyHow2009" role="doc-biblioref">Derrick et al., 2009</a>)</span>. The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy
regards this response as disengaged and prosocial, since relying on
social surrogates helps people passively avoid future threats to
belonging or control while simultaneously increasing perceived
connection with others.</p>
<p>Another disengaged prosocial response is experiencing nostalgia—a
sentimental yearning for the past and memories of social connections
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-abeytaLookingBackMove2015" role="doc-biblioref">Abeyta et al., 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-wildschutNostalgiaRepositorySocial2010" role="doc-biblioref">Wildschut et al., 2010</a>)</span>.
Rejected participants experienced more nostalgia compared with accepted
participants <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wildschutNostalgiaRepositorySocial2010" role="doc-biblioref">Wildschut et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Nostalgia is a
disengaged prosocial response because it functions to increase perceived
social connection with other people, but it does so in a hands-off way
that allows people to avoid additional threats to belonging or
self-control.</p>
<p>Taken together, responses to interpersonal rejection can be placed into
the four quadrants of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. Recognizing
these quadrants is important in planning and conducting studies. For
example, if a researcher provides engaged antisocial response options
and finds that rejected participants do not behave more antisocially
than included participants, they may incorrectly conclude that rejection
does not lead to antisocial responses. This conclusion may be inaccurate
because rejected participants may have instead used disengaged
antisocial responses if they were provided with the option to do so.
Researchers who incorporate the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy can
avoid faulty conclusions and reach a more calibrated interpretation of
their findings.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Using the Bi-Dimensional Rejection Taxonomy to Frame Existing Research</h2>
<p>The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy provides researchers with a more
nuanced and accurate understanding of responses to rejection.
Previously, researchers were constrained to conclude that certain
individual difference or situational factors caused either antisocial or
prosocial behavior following rejection, without the appropriate language
for specifying the type of antisocial or prosocial behavior being
displayed. In this section, we view past research within the new lens of
the taxonomy to look for individual differences and situational factors
that appear to predict variation along the engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis.
In doing so, we make inferences about the <em>y</em>-axis post-hoc based on the
available evidence, since the <em>y</em>-axis was not a part of the lexicon at
the time those studies were conducted. We omit factors exclusively
predicting variation along the antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis, such as
need fortification <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>)</span>,
because they have been extensively discussed elsewhere

two parts. The first part focuses on variation in engaged and disengaged
antisocial responses, and the second focuses on variation in engaged and

<p><strong>Interpersonal Sensitivity to Rejection (Rejection Sensitivity and
Self-Esteem).</strong> Some people worry about being rejected more than others.
This tendency is present among people with higher rejection sensitivity
and lower self-esteem <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-downeyImplicationsRejectionSensitivity1996" role="doc-biblioref">Downey &amp; Feldman, 1996</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-feldmanRejectionSensitivityMediator1994" role="doc-biblioref">Feldman &amp; Downey, 1994</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-learySelfesteemInterpersonalMonitor1995" role="doc-biblioref">Leary et al., 1995</a>)</span>. Although these constructs
have important differences, they share significant conceptual
underpinnings representing an overlapping construct, sensitivity to
rejection <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-crockerCostlyPursuitSelfesteem2004" role="doc-biblioref">Crocker &amp; Park, 2004</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-parkResponsesSelfthreatLinking2010" role="doc-biblioref">Park, 2010</a>)</span>. For these reasons, we label this
construct as <em>interpersonal sensitivity to rejection</em> and discuss the
construct in reference to both indices.</p>
<p>People with higher interpersonal sensitivity to rejection may be more
likely to use engaged antisocial responses rather than disengaged
antisocial responses (Figure <a href="the-bi-dimensional-rejection-taxonomy.html#fig:bidr-antisocial">2.3</a>). Specifically,
past evidence has demonstrated a consistent link between higher
interpersonal sensitivity and engaged antisocial behavior, such as
aggression <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aydukIndividualDifferencesRejection2008" role="doc-biblioref">Ayduk et al., 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-downeyRejectionSensitivityMale2000" role="doc-biblioref">Downey et al., 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-downeyRejectionSensitivityChildren1998" role="doc-biblioref">Downey, Lebolt, et al., 1998</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-downeySelffulfillingProphecyClose1998" role="doc-biblioref">Downey, Freitas, et al., 1998</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-murrayWhenRejectionStings2002" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2002</a>)</span>.
A review of the rejection sensitivity literature concludes that people
high in rejection sensitivity respond to rejection in hostile and
overtly aggressive ways <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-romero-canyasPayingBelongWhen2010" role="doc-biblioref">Romero-Canyas et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Also,
following a romantic relationship threat, people with lower self-esteem
derogated their romantic partner as being more lazy and thoughtless
relative to those with higher self-esteem
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-murrayWhenRejectionStings2002" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2002</a>)</span>. These engaged antisocial responses may
be the result of a self-fulfilling prophec<em>y</em>—people fearfully
expecting rejection can act in ways that provoke rejection from others,
such as putting down their romantic partner during face-to-face
interactions or perpetrating intimate partner violence
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-downeyRejectionSensitivityMale2000" role="doc-biblioref">Downey et al., 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-downeySelffulfillingProphecyClose1998" role="doc-biblioref">Downey, Freitas, et al., 1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Phobia.</strong> While the literature reviewed above consistently
demonstrates that people with higher interpersonal sensitivity to
rejection behave in engaged antisocial ways following rejection, related
literature shows the opposite pattern. Specifically, people with a
social phobia, an extreme form of interpersonal sensitivity to
rejection, often behave in disengaged antisocial ways. For example,
people with a social phobia often ruminate about social interactions
without engaging in them and avoid interacting with people (and thus
potential rejection) at all costs
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-clarkCognitivePerspectiveSocial2001" role="doc-biblioref">Clark, 2001</a>)</span>. In addition, people with a
social phobia tend to avoid eye contact and emotionally distance
themselves from others when experiencing interpersonal problems
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-aldenInterpersonalProcessesSocial2004" role="doc-biblioref">Alden &amp; Taylor, 2004</a>)</span>. Thus, at least some forms of
interpersonal sensitivity to rejection, in this case social phobia,
actually predict disengaged rather than engaged antisocial responses.</p>
<p>These subtle differences highlight the importance of the bi-dimensional
rejection taxonomy. Without the taxonomy, researchers would conclude
that people who are highly sensitive to rejection (both in terms of
rejection sensitivity, low self-esteem, and social phobia) behave in
antisocial ways following rejection. Using the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy, we can see that the most extreme form of sensitivity to
rejection (social phobia) leads to disengaged antisocial behavior,
whereas other forms of sensitivity to rejection (e.g., low self-esteem)
lead to engaged antisocial behavior. Noticing this subtle yet important
difference in responses allows researchers to begin asking why a
difference exists. For example, armed with the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy, we could begin asking whether methodological differences could
explain why interpersonal sensitivity led to engaged versus disengaged
antisocial responses (e.g., did each study provide participants with
both engaged and disengaged antisocial response options?). We could also
begin wondering whether there is something qualitatively different
between a more extreme, clinical interpersonal sensitivity versus those
in the normative range. Without the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy
that differentiates disengaged and engaged antisocial responses,
researchers wouldn’t be able to ask these important questions. The
taxonomy thus sheds light on an existing gap in our knowledge, spurring
future research.</p>
<p><strong>History of Repeated Rejection Experiences.</strong> Another related
literature about repeated rejection experiences also highlights the
importance of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. People have
different histories of being rejected—some have experienced rejection
more often than others (e.g., students who were bullied vs. those who
were not). A repeated history of rejection plays an important role in
promoting antisocial responses to rejection, as highlighted by existing
theories <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bowlbySeparationAnxietyAnger2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bowlby, 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-horneyNeurosisHumanGrowth1991" role="doc-biblioref">Horney, 1991</a>)</span>. For example, children who experience
prolonged rejection from an attachment figure develop hostile views
towards others, which then promotes expression of anger and aggression
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bowlbySeparationAnxietyAnger2000" role="doc-biblioref">Bowlby, 2000</a>)</span>. In addition, a history of repeated
rejection can foster a sensitivity to interpersonal rejection
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-londonSocialCausesConsequences2007" role="doc-biblioref">London et al., 2007</a>)</span>, which leads to antisocial
responses. Thus, a researcher might conclude that both a repeated
history of rejection and an interpersonal sensitivity to rejection lead
to antisocial responses following rejection. This conclusion would be
reasonable prior to the existence of the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy. However, a close inspection of the literature, viewed through
the lens of the taxonomy, paints a different picture. Specifically,
repeated rejection results in feelings of helplessness, unworthiness,
submission, withdrawal, and avoidance of social interactions, described
as “going into a little shell” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-rivaChronicSocialExclusion2017" role="doc-biblioref">Riva et al., 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-williamsOstracismTemporalNeedthreat2009" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-zadroOstracismEmpiricalStudies2004" role="doc-biblioref">Zadro, 2004</a>)</span>. Thus, people who experienced
repeated rejection use more disengaged antisocial responses to rejection
(e.g., withdrawing from others), rather than engaged antisocial
responses (e.g., attacking others; Figure <a href="the-bi-dimensional-rejection-taxonomy.html#fig:bidr-antisocial">2.3</a>).
Why would people with a history of repeated rejection behave in
disengaged antisocial ways, whereas those with high rejection
sensitivity behave in engaged antisocial ways—particularly because a
history of rejection can lead to rejection sensitivity? The
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy offers a more nuanced understanding of
antisocial responses, identifies this knowledge gap, and allows
researchers to ask questions that would previously not have been
possible. Although the taxonomy itself does not directly answer these
questions, it provides researchers with the language needed to ask these
questions in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Approach-Avoidance Tendency.</strong> People differ in their tendency to
approach or avoid a social outcome. In general, people with
approach-oriented tendencies actively pursue desirable outcomes, whereas
people with avoidance-oriented tendencies avoid undesirable outcomes
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-elliotApproachAvoidanceMotivation2006" role="doc-biblioref">Elliot et al., 2006</a>)</span>. In the context of rejection,
the desired outcome is re-establishing belonging, and the undesired
outcome is experiencing further rejection. Ultimately, people must
balance these two goals to maintain meaningful interpersonal
relationships <span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="references.html#ref-murrayOptimizingAssuranceRisk2006" role="doc-biblioref">Murray et al., 2006</a>)</span>. Prior to the
bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy, researchers would predict that
avoidance-oriented people would not display prosocial responses
following rejection, because the types of prosocial responses typically
studied have risks of further rejection (e.g., actively seeking
acceptance from another person). With the taxonomy, we can see that this
hypothesis may not be accurate. Theoretically, people with higher
avoidance tendencies would display prosocial responses, but they would
do so in disengaged ways (e.g., relying on social surrogates) because
this response style matches their general tendency to use hands-off,
avoidance-oriented strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Orientation.</strong> Cultural contexts influence how people rely on
social support, a form of prosocial behavior motivated by a need for
affiliation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-choenaromRoleSenseBelonging2005" role="doc-biblioref">Choenarom et al., 2005</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-hagertyEffectsSenseBelonging1999" role="doc-biblioref">Hagerty &amp; Williams, 1999 Jul-Aug</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-kimCultureSocialSupport2008" role="doc-biblioref">Kim et al., 2008</a>)</span>.
Compared with people with individualistic backgrounds (e.g., European
Americans), those with collectivistic backgrounds (e.g., Asian
Americans) sought more <em>implicit</em> forms of social support—emotional
comfort obtained through the existing social network without directly
discussing one’s problems <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-kimCultureSocialSupport2008" role="doc-biblioref">Kim et al., 2008</a>)</span>. Implicit
support seeking is disengaged because it is a passive behavior that
allows a person to avoid potential rejection and thus future threats to
belonging. On the other hand, explicit support seeking is engaged
because it involves direct communication of the need for support to
close others. Taken together, people with collectivistic backgrounds may
use more disengaged rather than engaged prosocial responses to
rejection, and people with individualistic backgrounds may use more
engaged rather than disengaged prosocial responses to rejection (Figure
<a href="the-bi-dimensional-rejection-taxonomy.html#fig:bidr-prosocial">2.4</a>).</p>
<p>These cultural predictions further highlight the risk of neglecting the
engaged-disengaged <em>y</em>-axis, and how doing so could lead to incorrect
conclusions. If a researcher measures only engaged prosocial responses
(i.e., explicit support seeking), they would reach the erroneous
conclusion that people from a collectivistic background do not engage in
prosocial behavior following rejection. However, they theoretically
behave prosocially following rejection, but they do so in disengaged
ways (e.g., implicit support seeking). Considering both dimensions of
the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy will prevent such faulty
conclusions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Using the Bi-Dimensional Rejection Taxonomy to Inspire New and More Accurate Hypotheses</h2>
<p>As we highlight throughout the paper, the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy is an important advancement to the rejection literature because
it helps researchers generate more nuanced and accurate hypotheses and
prevents inaccurate conclusions. The taxonomy draws on available
theories to make predictions about which individual and situational
characteristics will predict when people will respond in one way or
another. In doing so, the taxonomy allows researchers to generate
innovative hypothesis incorporating all possible response options. In
this section, we discuss how the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy
inspires new directions for future research. In contrast to the previous
sections that demonstrated how existing evidence could be viewed through
the lens of the taxonomy, this section purposefully highlights more
speculative and innovative avenues for new research that have yet to be
tested. Thus, the reader should take these future directions with a
grain of salt; they are meant to inspire new and exciting ways to apply
the taxonomy.</p>
<div id="spontaneous-reactions-to-rejection" class="section level3" number="2.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> Spontaneous Reactions to Rejection</h3>
<p>Past rejection studies relied on laboratory experiments where behavioral
and self-reported response options were constrained. For example, in the
hot-sauce paradigm, participants had no choice but to allocate some
amount of hot sauce to a stranger without an option to respond
differently (Lieberman, Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; McGregor, 1999). Questions
remain as to how rejected participants respond in real-life settings
where other response options are readily available (e.g., rejected
people can watch their favorite TV show, approach a friend, lash out
against the perpetrator, or withdraw from others). In addition, people
experiencing rejection may use multiple responses simultaneously (e.g.,
watching favorite TV shows and talking to friends after getting dumped).
The existing literature has not investigated which responses people
commonly use following rejection in the real world—an important next
step to advance the literature. One concrete recommendation is to have
at least four types of response options in rejection studies. For
example, daily diary or experience sampling studies could assess whether
rejection occurred that day, and if so, could ask how the participant
responded, ensuring that response options from each quadrant are
included.</p>
<p>Without the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy, researchers interested in
prosocial responses may inadvertently fail to measure disengaged
prosocial responses (e.g., watching a favorite TV program) and may
instead solely focus on engaged prosocial responses (e.g., approaching a
friend). Doing so brings with it the danger of concluding that prosocial
responses do not happen in response to everyday rejection whereas, in
reality, they may be happening, but in disengaged rather than engaged
manners. Armed with the knowledge of the bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy, researchers can now avoid this pitfall and include response
options that cover both dimensions.</p>
<p>An unexplored possibility is that people typically react to everyday
rejection in disengaged ways (e.g., social surrogacy and social
withdrawal). Past research has found that interpersonal rejection is
prevalent in everyday life, ranging from subtle ignorance in social
situations (e.g., no eye contact and being looked-through) to more
obvious ones [e.g., being ignored in conversations, emails, and online
messaging; <span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-nezlekOstracismEverydayLife2012" role="doc-biblioref">Nezlek et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-nezlekOstracismEverydayLife2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>]. People need to regularly
cope with these rejection experiences to maintain their belonging. As
mentioned earlier, repeated experiences of rejection may promote
disengaged responses, particularly in the antisocial domain. We
speculate a similar pattern for the prosocial domain—people may use
disengaged prosocial responses, rather than engaged prosocial responses
for repeated everyday rejection. People can replenish belonging more
safely through disengaged prosocial responses because they function to
avoid future need threat (i.e., further rejection). The popularity of
TV, books, and social media may reflect people’s preference in
satisfying belonging from these disengaged prosocial activities, a
provocative question for future research.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> Neurophysiological Markers</h3>
<p>Neurophysiological correlates can provide mechanistic answers about why
rejection leads to responses that fall within the bi-dimensional
rejection taxonomy. Cortisol and testosterone are potentially relevant
hormonal markers that can predict rejection responses. The combination
of high testosterone and low cortisol levels jointly predict
dominance-seeking behaviors, often associated with engaged antisocial
behaviors (e.g., physical fights and violence;
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-mehtaTestosteroneCortisolJointly2010" role="doc-biblioref">Mehta &amp; Josephs, 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-platjeTestosteroneCortisolRelation2015" role="doc-biblioref">Platje et al., 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-romero-martinezTestosteroneCortisolRatio2013" role="doc-biblioref">Romero-MartÃÂnez et al., 2013</a>)</span>. When cortisol levels are
high, dominance responses are inhibited (and submission responses are
facilitated), regardless of testosterone levels. Thus, one unexamined
hypothesis is that high testosterone and low cortisol levels may
facilitate engaged antisocial responses to rejection. On the other hand,
high cortisol levels may inhibit engaged antisocial responses and may
instead facilitate disengaged antisocial responses (e.g., social
withdrawal and self-neglect).</p>
<p>Considering the interaction between cortisol and testosterone highlights
the importance of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy. If researchers
study cortisol and testosterone in the absence of the taxonomy and
measure only engaged antisocial responses, they may conclude that
cortisol levels do not affect antisocial responses at all. In light of
the current taxonomy, this conclusion may be unwarranted—since high
cortisol levels should theoretically facilitate disengaged antisocial
responses.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.3</span> Applying the Bi-Dimensional Rejection Taxonomy to Other Threats to Belonging</h3>
<p>The bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy offers a blueprint for future
researchers who study responses to social stressors that threaten
belonging. Currently, the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy is focused
on the responses to interpersonal rejection (e.g., feeling uncared for
or unloved). But, other social stressors can also threaten belonging,
such as separation distress [e.g., feelings of missing someone;
<span class="citation"><a href="references.html#ref-diamondEveryTimeYou2008" role="doc-biblioref">Diamond et al.</a> (<a href="references.html#ref-diamondEveryTimeYou2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>], death of a close other
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-stroebeRoleLonelinessSocial1996" role="doc-biblioref">Stroebe et al., 1996</a>)</span>, and
discrimination<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-richmanReactionsDiscriminationStigmatization2009" role="doc-biblioref">Richman &amp; Leary, 2009</a>)</span>. One
interesting application of the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy would
be to examine whether responses to these belonging threats also range
along the antisocial–prosocial and engaged–disengaged dimensions.
Doing so will facilitate a richer understanding of how humans respond to
belonging threats.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2" number="2.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Existing theories of interpersonal rejection have exclusively focused on
the <em>x</em>-axis, aiming to understand antisocial and prosocial responses to
interpersonal rejection. Accumulating evidence suggests a gap in this
approach: variability in social responses to rejection cannot solely be
explained by the antisocial–prosocial dimension alone. To fill this
gap, we propose the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy, consisting of the
antisocial–prosocial <em>x</em>-axis and engaged–disengaged <em>y</em>-axis, a novel
contribution to the literature. This engaged–disengaged dimension
explains variation among prosocial and antisocial responses previously
unaccounted for, helps researchers to generate more nuanced and accurate
hypotheses about how people respond to rejection, and sheds light on the
types of responses that have been understudied in the literature. Thus,
the bi-dimensional rejection taxonomy is an important step forward for
the rejection literature. Overlooking the engaged–disengaged dimension
could result in omnibus hypotheses that lack specificity, leading to
erroneous and inaccurate conclusions. The bi-dimensional rejection
taxonomy helps researchers to see nuances among responses, better
calibrate conclusions, and test novel predictions. With this new map, we
can move the literature to new frontiers.</p>
